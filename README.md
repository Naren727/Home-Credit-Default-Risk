Kaggle Competition : Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan?


Home credit default risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay their loan in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions, resulting in a loss for the lender. Home credit is a type of loan that is secured against a property, such as a mortgage, and the lender relies on the value of the property as collateral for the loan.

To assess the default risk of a borrower, lenders typically consider a range of factors such as the borrower's credit history, income, employment status, debt-to-income ratio, and the value of the property being used as collateral. Lenders may also use statistical models and algorithms to analyze large amounts of data and predict the likelihood of default.

Reducing home credit default risk is a key priority for lenders, as defaults can result in significant financial losses. Lenders may take steps to mitigate default risk, such as requiring a higher down payment or imposing more stringent lending criteria. Additionally, borrowers can reduce their default risk by maintaining good credit, paying their bills on time, and not taking on more debt than they can comfortably afford.
